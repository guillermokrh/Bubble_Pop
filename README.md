# Bubble_Pop
Submission of Homework 5 for CS141

For this assignment I was tasked with implementing the module/ADT for the game "Bubble Pop".  I was given the header file 'bboard.h',
which lists the functions and struct types necessary, and I created bboard.c from scratch.  We were given bpop.c as a general client
for testing and debugging.  

'bboard.c' is a good example of my general coding style.  I do a lot of incremental testing as I code, and my tests are flagged
with the comment '//debug'. I have not removed them from my code in this example, though normally I would remove them after
finishing the file.  I also like using whitespace and indentation for readability, as well as ample comments of my logic and 
intent.  I find comments especially useful when retracing my logic during debugging and thinking about edge cases for testing. I also enjoy writing descriptive variable and function names as much as possible, since I also find this helps me when
designing solutions that make use of those variables/funtions.
